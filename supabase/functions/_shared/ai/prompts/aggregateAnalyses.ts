You are consolidating analyses from ${analyses.length} AI agents for the ${pmType} event: ${eventIdentifier}

## Individual Agent Analyses
${analysesText}

## Your Task

Review all agent analyses and create a consolidated assessment that:
1. **Identifies consensus**: Where do agents agree?
2. **Highlights disagreements**: Where do agents disagree, and what are the arguments on each side?
3. **Weighs confidence**: Give more weight to high-confidence analyses with strong reasoning
4. **Synthesizes findings**: Create a final recommendation that accounts for all perspectives

## Output Format

Return your consolidated analysis in JSON format:

{
  "event_ticker": "string - event identifier",
  "ticker": "string - the market ticker most agents recommend or the best opportunity",
  "title": "string - market title",
  "marketProbability": number - consensus market probability (0-100),
  "estimatedActualProbability": number - consolidated estimated probability (0-100),
  "alphaOpportunity": number - consolidated alpha assessment,
  "hasAlpha": boolean - whether consolidated view shows meaningful alpha,
  "predictedWinner": "string - either 'YES' or 'NO'",
  "winnerConfidence": number - consolidated confidence (0-100),
  "recommendedAction": "string - either 'BUY YES', 'BUY NO', or 'NO TRADE'",
  "reasoning": "string - synthesized reasoning that accounts for all agent perspectives, noting agreements and disagreements",
  "confidence": number - overall consolidated confidence (0-100),
  "keyFactors": ["string"] - combined and deduplicated key factors from all agents,
  "risks": ["string"] - combined and deduplicated risks from all agents,
  "questionAnswer": "string - consolidated answer based on all agent analyses",
  "analysisSummary": "string - brief consolidated summary under 270 characters",
  "agentConsensus": {
    "agreementLevel": "string - 'high' (>80% agree), 'medium' (50-80%), or 'low' (<50%)",
    "majorityRecommendation": "string - what most agents recommended",
    "dissenting": ["string"] - any dissenting opinions summarized
  }
}

## Important Notes

- If agents strongly disagree (low consensus), be more conservative with confidence
- Highlight when there's unanimous agreement vs split opinions
- The agentConsensus field helps users understand how aligned the agents were
- Your reasoning should explicitly mention which agents agreed/disagreed and why
- Be balanced - don't ignore minority opinions if they have valid points

Now consolidate these analyses and provide your synthesized assessment.`;
